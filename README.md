# BlueTerm ++
Modified version of pymasde.es' BlueTerm App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.pymasde.blueterm). 
I added support of past from clipboard and fixed bug that couldn't allow you to use Volume up and Volume down keys as Control key.

Original BlueTerm description:
VT-100 terminal emulator for communicating with any serial device using a bluetooth serial adapter. The RFCOMM/SPP protocol emulates serial communications over bluetooth.
You need a bluetooth serial adapter.
This is an opensource application. You can get more info and the source code from:
